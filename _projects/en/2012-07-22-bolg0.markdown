My first little game, to learn how works hitboxs and discover threads in same time.  
Made with Java (awt). You are a little ball and you have to catch the sqaure to earn points.  
But be careful with the other balls !  
Then you have a second level when the window grow up ! Don't miss the Pringles !  
At the end, i let you found how to reach the boss.
Just use arrow to play.
